Brings back minecart boosting from earlier beta versions of Minecraft.

Cart Boosts requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Cart Boosts from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cart-boosts/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Cart-Boosts/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

Place two parallel tracks with minecarts next to each other. This will cause the minecarts to start moving together and boosting each other.
